# Weather forecasting

> **Abstract** : Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a given location.Here this system will predict weather based on parameters such as temperature, humidity and wind. User will enter current temperature, humidity and wind, System will take this parameter and will predict weather(rainfall in inches) from previous data in database(dataset). The role of the admin is to add previous weather data in database, so that system will calculate weather(estimated rainfall in inches) based on these data. Weather forecasting system takes parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind and will forecast weather based on previous record therefore this prediction will prove reliable. This system can be used in Air Traffic, Marine, Agriculture, Forestry, Military, and Navy etc.
